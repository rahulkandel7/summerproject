            <strong>Homie Nepal</strong>, a rental agency, allows you to list your rooms or apartments for rent. You can list any rooms or flats for rent here. WE ARE HERE FOR YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROPERTY AVAILABLE FOR RENT TO ANOTHER PLACE. We will make it simple for you to discover a rental individual. We will look for and select a person based on your expectations.

                    You must first register on our website, and only you will be able to do so.  You will be able to add the listing once you have registered and logged in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have the authority to set the rules and regulations for your property. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may set the pricing for your flat or room to anything you like.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You must provide pictures of your property so that people can understand more about it and see it clearly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can specify the sort of individual you require in your flat.
                </li>
            </ul>
               
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            You can change the descriptions and rules after listing the property. We only show the property to others if they are eligible. You will have complete control over the rental authority judgment. If someone likes your room or apartment and agrees to the terms, we will only bring that individual to you.
            We only charge <strong>15%</strong> of the rental price for one term. Our fee will be a one-time charge. We are simply here to make your life easier.
