            How Homie Nepal Work
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
            Homie Nepal is a rental agency whose major goal is to find individuals who need a place to stay. Homeowners can advertise their property and expect people to visit their flats. We will do our best to assist individuals. We only wish to make people's lives simpler. We just want to establish a platform where people can post their property and others can view the listings and pick based on their needs.

            Our operational concept is simple: if someone adds a property, we will display it to another individual who wants to rent it. If someone adds a property, we will validate it by contacting them and only then will we expose it to the other users. We just act as a go-between for the landlord and the tenant. We will not participate in either party's decision-making process.
           Whether anybody is interested in the property, we will call them and ask if they are serious about seeing it. If they are, we will show them the property. If everything goes as planned, we will proceed to the next step.
           We will collect a little fee from both sides. If we are able to supply the accommodation, we will charge the rental person  10% and 15% of the first month's rental price from the landlord. We are here to make your life easier.
